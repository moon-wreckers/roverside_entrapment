## Abstract

Entrapment detection is a prerequisite for planetary rovers to perform autonomous rescue procedure. In this study, rover entrapment and approximated entrapment criteria are formally defined. Entrapment detection using Naive Bayes classifiers is proposed and discussed along with results from experiments where the Naive Bayes entrapment detector is applied to AutoKralwer rovers.
